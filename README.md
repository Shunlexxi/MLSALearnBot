# MLSA LearnBot - MLSA AI Project | June to August Cohort

ðŸš€ Welcome to the GitHub repository for our AI Project Submission!

## Project Description
### The OpportunityÂ 
We've all been there â€” stuck in a loop, trying to find the right information, only to end up more confused and frustrated. Whether it's navigating through countless documents or waiting for responses, finding the help you need can sometimes feel like a daunting task.

This struggle is particularly true for Student Ambassadors who often need quick and accurate information to support their roles. The process of sifting through resources can be time-consuming, leaving them with less time to focus on what really matters â€” engaging with their peers and making an impact.

## Our SolutionÂ 
That's where our solution comes in. We set out to build an Intelligent Chatbot (Question-and-Answer) app designed specifically for Student Ambassadors. 

### Our goal? 
To leverage cutting-edge AI and ensure that finding help and information is as seamless and efficient as possible.
With our chatbot, Student Ambassadors can get instant answers to their questions, access relevant resources, and navigate their responsibilities with confidence â€”all within a single, user-friendly interface

## Technologies Used
To build this powerful tool, we utilized a robust stack of technologies, including; 
- Azure Web App for seamless deployment
- AI Search for enhanced search capabilities
- OpenAI for natural language processing
- The development process was streamlined with GitHub for version control
- Visual Studio Code as our primary IDE
Copilot for AI-assisted coding. 
- Additionally, Microsoft Word was used for documentation

## Takeaways
### What do we recommend our audience start doing?Â 
To start using AI-powered solutions like our chatbot to quickly access accurate and relevant information. Start leveraging technology that is designed to simplify and streamline their workflow.

### What can be done without you?Â 
The chatbot can operate autonomously, providing instant responses to queries without requiring constant human intervention. Users can continue to use the chatbot to find information and resources at any time, without bothering the support team.

### How could our solution speed up the process or simplify it?
Speed Up the Process: Our AI-driven chatbot drastically reduces the time spent searching for information by delivering answers in real-time. Users might no longer need to navigate multiple sources, and the wait time for human assistance would be significantly reduced.

Simplify It: The chatbot offers a single, user-friendly interface that consolidates all necessary information and resources, making the search process intuitive and straightforward.
